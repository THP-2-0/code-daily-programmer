# Code Daily Programmer

## Intro

  This repository was created with two goals in mind :
  - give optionnal daily coding exercices to THP students
  - provide these students with the opportunity to manage a github project

## Process

  1. Go to the slack channel #code-daily-programmer and retrieve the exercice of the day.
  2. Go to this repository's project *Daily exercices* and create a note in the targeted column.
  3. Convert the note into an issue.
  4. Edit the issue and paste the content of the exercice.
  5. Organize the content into 3 titles :
    ..- Source (meaning url where the exercice comes from)
    ..- Exercice (the content of the exercise itself)
    ..- Hints
